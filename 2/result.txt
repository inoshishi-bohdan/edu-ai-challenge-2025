Sure! Here's a structured bug ticket based on the informal report:

---

**1. Title**
Logout Button Unresponsive on Safari Browser

**2. Description**
The logout button does not function as expected when accessed via the Safari browser. When clicked, there is no response — no navigation, UI feedback, or logout action is triggered. The issue appears to be specific to Safari, as the button works correctly on other browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

**3. Steps to Reproduce**

1. Open the application in the Safari browser.
2. Log in with valid user credentials.
3. Navigate to the main/dashboard page.
4. Click on the "Logout" button.

**4. Expected vs Actual Behavior**
*Expected:*
Clicking the logout button should log the user out and redirect them to the login screen or homepage.

*Actual:*
Clicking the logout button does nothing — the user remains logged in, and the page does not change.

**5. Environment (if known)**

* Browser: Safari (exact version unknown; latest reported)
* OS: macOS (version not specified)
* User role: \[assumed any logged-in user]

**6. Severity or Impact**
**High** – Users are unable to log out using Safari, which may lead to session management issues and user frustration. This affects basic application functionality and user trust.
