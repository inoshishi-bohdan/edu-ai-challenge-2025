In the attached file you have a few examples of processing feedbacks. Based on that information analyze me these two samples: Sample 1: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"
Sample 2: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs.". Analyze feedback using CoT reasoning to define if it is relevant to the product or not, If not, set isRelevant to false and skip further analysis. The structure for the output is following: 
{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}
