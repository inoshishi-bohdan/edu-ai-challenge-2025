# Enigma Machine Bug Fix Report

## Problem
The Enigma machine implementation had critical bugs that prevented correct encryption/decryption behavior. The most significant issue was that encrypting the same text twice did not return the original message, breaking the Enigma's fundamental reciprocal property.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Second Plugboard Swap
**Bug**: The plugboard transformation was only applied at the input, not at the output.

**Impact**: This broke the symmetric nature of Enigma encryption. In a real Enigma, the electrical signal passes through the plugboard twice - once on entry and once on exit.

**Fix**: Added `plugboardSwap(c, this.plugboardPairs)` after the backward rotor pass.

### 2. Asymmetric Reflector
**Bug**: The reflector mapping was not properly symmetric. For example, if A mapped to Y, Y did not map back to A.

**Impact**: This violated the reciprocal property where encrypt(encrypt(text)) should equal the original text.

**Fix**: Implemented proper Enigma Reflector B with symmetric pairs: AY, BR, CU, DH, EQ, FS, GL, IP, JX, KN, MO, TZ, VW.

### 3. Incorrect Rotor Stepping Logic
**Bug**: The double-stepping mechanism was implemented incorrectly, causing rotors to advance at wrong times.

**Impact**: This affected the rotor positions during encryption, leading to incorrect character substitutions.

**Fix**: Rewrote the stepping logic to properly handle the double-stepping anomaly where the middle rotor steps twice in succession.

## Verification
The fixed implementation now correctly demonstrates the Enigma's reciprocal property:
- Encrypting a message and then encrypting the result with identical settings returns the original text
- All rotor mechanics follow historical Enigma behavior
- Plugboard and reflector operations are properly symmetric

## Result
The Enigma machine now functions as a proper reciprocal cipher, maintaining historical accuracy and cryptographic correctness.
