A young woman presents to the emergency room with a three-day history of sharp chest pain that worsens with coughing and lying down but improves when leaning forward. She reports no other significant symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea, and has a recent history of flu. She is concerned about a heart attack, especially given her father's recent passing from a heart attack two weeks ago. The medical team plans to perform an ECG and blood tests to evaluate her condition, reassuring her to stay calm while they investigate the cause of her symptoms.
